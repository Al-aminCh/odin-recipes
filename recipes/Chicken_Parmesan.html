    <p><strong>Chicken Parmesan is one of those meals that's often best made in your own kitchen.</strong></p>
    <p>Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
